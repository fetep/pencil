== SYNOPSIS

pencil: graphite dashboarding frontend

pencil is a monitoring frontend for graphite. It runs a webserver that dishes
out pretty graphite urls in hopefully interesting and intuitive layouts.

Some features are:

* Implicit collection of host and cluster data

  pencil picks these up from graphite without you having to explicitly define
  them. You need only supply the metrics; see SETUP for configuration details.

* Relative and absolute timespecs with auto-refresh

  Timeslices are measured in terms of a (possibly relative) starting time and a
  duration. Timespecs are parsed using the chronic[http://chronic.rubyforge.org/] and
  chronic_duration[https://github.com/hpoydar/chronic_duration] gems.

* permalinks

  Turn a relative timeslice (such as the last 8 hours) into an absolute one for
  placing in bug reports and all sorts of other useful things.

* Lots of navigation UI for bouncing around the different views

== INSTALL

Eventually it should just be:

gem install pencil

...but it isn't yet.

Dependencies are:

* rack
* sinatra
* json
* chronic
* chronic_duration
* (fixme versions)

== SETUP

You should have a working graphite installation. Your metrics need to be
composed of three pieces:

* "%m", _METRIC_ (the common part of each graphite path)
* "%c", _CLUSTER_ (cluster name, varies with query)
* "%h", _HOST_ (host name, varies with query)

The :metric_format string is specified in the configuration file (see below),
and defaults to %m.%c.%h".

You need to set up some YAML configuration files in order for pencil to
work. Pencil searches the current directory (or, with -d DIR, DIR) for YAML
files to load.

The important top-level configuration keys are:

* :config: general config options
* :graphs: see below
* :dashboards: see below

See examples/ for an example configuration directory.  Here's
examples/pencil.yml, which contains general configuration options:

:config :
  :graphite_url : URL # graphite URL
  :url_opts :
    :width : 1000
    :height : 400
    :fontSize : 15
    :start : "8 hours ago"  # in chronic timespec format
    :template : "noc"
    :yMin : 0
    :margin : 5
    :thickness : 2

  :refresh_rate : 60        # how often to refresh the view
  :host_sort : "numeric"    # add this if you want to sort hosts numerically
  :quantum : 30             # map requests to 30 second intervals
  :date_format : "%X %x"    # strftime
  :metric_format : "%m.%c.%h" #%m metric, %c cluster, %h host

A graph is a name, title, collection of targets, and some other options. It
looks like (in YAML):

  graph_name:             # name pencil references this graph by
    title: "graph_title"  # title displayed on graph
    targets:              # list of graphite targets
      metric.1:
        :key : key         # key displayed on the legend for this metric
        :color : color     # color on the graph for this metric
      metric.2:
        :key : key
        :color : color
      [...]
    stack: true           # whether to stack or not
    hosts: ["hosts1*", "test*_web", "hosts2*"] # filter on hosts

fixme A target is a metric or list of metrics and associated graphite options.

Similarly, a dashboard is a name, title, collection of graphs, and some other
options. It looks like (in YAML):

  dash_name:
    title: dash_title
    graphs:
      - graph1:
        hosts: ["sync*_web"] # additional hosts filter specific to this graph
        other_opt: val       # possibly other options in the future
      - graph2:
      [...]
    hosts: ["filter1*", "*filter2"]

== RUNNING THE SERVER
Once you've set up the configs, you should be able to just run

pencil

and get something up on localhost:9292

From there you should be able to click around and see various interesting
collections of graphs.

With no options, pencil looks for ./pencil.yml as the default config file.

You can bind to a specific port with -p PORT and specify a configuration
directory with -d DIR. Other rack-related options will be added at some point
in the future.
